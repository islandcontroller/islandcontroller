### :wave: *Hi there!*

I'm *island* - a hardware and software engineer, and an open-source enthusiast!

My *academic background* is a Master's degree in the field of microelectronic systems and digital control at the Hamburg University of Applied Sciences and the FH Westk√ºste in Germany. My thesis project covered the topics of RISC-V processor architecture and fault-tolerant hardware design. 

* B.Sc. Electronics Engineering and Information Technology (IuE)
* M.Sc. Microelectronic Systems (MES)

As for my *professional background*, I work as an Embedded Systems Development Engineer at a major german industrial drive technology manufacturer, and specialise in software development for functional safety applications, high-speed communication interfaces and automated testing.

* Safety-critical systems development (IEC 61508, SIL3/PLe)
* Custom USB, CAN and Ethernet communication stack implementations
* Traceable, automated testing using Hardware-In-The-Loop
